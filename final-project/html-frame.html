Bettye Gardner remembers her family telling her the tragic story of William Henderson Foote, her granduncle who was lynched in Yazoo City, Mississippi, in 1883. Foote’s death was one of at least 25 documented lynchings from 1875-1927 in rural Yazoo County, the Mississippi county with the most lynchings during the period, according to a Howard Center for Investigative Journalism analysis of the Beck-Tolnay Inventory of Southern Lynch Victims.
</p>
          <p>
Foote, a Black federal deputy collector, was killed five days after a dispute on Christmas Eve, when he tried to save another Black Yazooan, John James, from being whipped, according to a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) report. The conflict resulted in four dead white men, according to some news accounts, and the arrest of Foote, along with 10 other Black people. An angry mob formed seeking revenge for the deaths, and lynched Foote, Robert Swayze, Richard Gibbs and Micajah Parker.
</p> <p>
Foote was born in 1843 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, to a family that could trace its free lineage to his paternal grandmother. Because of this legacy, Gardner said Foote expected to be treated as an equal citizen. “He put himself in positions in Yazoo City, where, increasingly, whites were making threats against him and his family,” she said.
</p>
          <p>
Foote was involved in politics and advocated for Black voting and civil rights. He was appointed the constable of Yazoo City in 1869, joined the Mississippi Legislature from 1870-71 and later became the town’s circuit clerk, according to the ATF. In 1880, Foote became a deputy collector in a town of 2,542 people, where he collected the revenue from liquor wholesalers and retailers.
</p>
          <p>
On Dec. 29, 1883, he became the first Black federal officer killed in the line of duty, according to the ATF historian who researched the case.
</p>
          <p>
The Yazoo City Herald, a white-owned newspaper, covered Foote’s lynching and numerous other cases, sometimes delivering inconsistent or problematic reporting.
</p>
          <p>
The Herald seesawed between justifying and opposing the act of lynching — in the case of Foote, doing so in the same story. It provided a forum to those with pro-lynching perspectives through letters to the editor. And it used dehumanizing language in reference to Black people.
</p>
          <p>
It reported that Foote was shot and killed after he used an andiron to attack a man who entered his jail cell. An article described Foote as “a courageous man and a powerful one” and then compared him to an animal in the same sentence, writing “it is said he fought with the ferocity of a tiger and the courage of an African lion.” The mob hanged Swayze, Gibbs and Parker.
</p>
          <p>
The same article about Foote presented the virtues of lynching and advocated against it, saying: “The lynching was a desperate remedy, but the disease was a desperate one,” and “whites frequently do the negroes great wrong, and should be punished more frequently than they are.”
</p>
          <p>
In 1920, the paper mentioned Foote’s lynching in a piece called “A BIT HISTORICAL,” saying the Christmas riot of 1883 was a “dark page” of Yazoo’s history. The Herald wrote about the lynching again in 1976, providing a more complete, detailed version of the event and Foote’s role in the Yazoo community.
</p>
          <p>
“Thus ended the last violence which was related to the tragic Reconstruction Era. W.H. Foote, from all indications a moderate during this struggle, was one of the last victims of its violence,” the article said.
</p>
          <p>
In 2012, Barbara Osteika, then a historian for the ATF, was researching ATF federal officers killed in the line of duty for an honor wall the bureau was building. She discovered Foote’s story in reading an article Gardner had written for Southern Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal of the South, and newspaper articles.
</p>
          <p>
“I became extremely interested in not only vetting but getting these stories out because these are federal law enforcement officers who make the ultimate sacrifice for a profession that sometimes doesn’t give back — especially, especially someone like Foote,” Osteika said.
